# odin-recipes

In this project, I will create a basic website using what I've learned about HTML so far. I will showcase some basic HTML elements such as links and images, as well as text formatting with headings, paragraphs, bold, italics, etc. 

The website will display some simple recipes (almost certainly made up ones) and will probably look terrible compared to any modern, well made website. But dammit, it's mine.
